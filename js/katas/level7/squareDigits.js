const squareDigits = num => {
    //Psuedo Code breakdown
    //Goal of code: take some number and square all of the digits in that number and concatenate all of the results into one super number
    //take num as an argument of squareDigits - done


    //split the value of num into an array with each single digit being it's own element
    //square each digit in array
    //use join to return one big happy family
    //ensure that returned family is an integer - Yay!
